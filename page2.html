        He looked up and grunted when she entered the room.
        “Good, you’re back. We have to go through today’s minutes and compile a list of the most pertinent facts.
        Then take care of the day’s correspondence. You get started on that; 
        I have to make a few phone calls.”

        He turned away from her and lifted his phone to his ear. 
        Cleo stared at his broad back for a moment before trudging over to the laptop with a muffled sigh. 
        She wondered if he’d ordered room service yet; she was starving. 
        She glanced around the room and gasped in outrage when she saw the room-service cart standing 
        off to the side of the room, with the uncovered empty plates precariously stacked one on top of the other.

        She picked up the room telephone to order her own meal, 
        but he had finished his call and cast her a sharp look.
